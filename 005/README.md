# day 005

sketch using pygame, aubio, and rtmidi to try and break a wine glass using resonant frequency.

didn't get it broken today, but got nice resonance with the straw.

## sketch video generated in camera 

no commands today, to reproduce, start the app, hit your wine glass, press spacebar to record the frequency.

it'll then start playing out your speaker. by default you can adjust with a midi device, because that's what I did.
